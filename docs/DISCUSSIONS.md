## What are GitHub Discussions?

GitHub Discussions is a collaborative communication forum for the community around a project. Discussions are for conversations that need to be accessible but don't need to be tracked on a project board and don't relate to specific code changes.

## Categories in Discussions

- **Announcements**: Important updates from the maintainers
- **General**: Anything and everything relevant to the project
- **Ideas**: Share ideas for new features
- **Q&A**: Ask questions and get answers from the community
- **Show and tell**: Share what you've built

## How to Participate

1. Be respectful and considerate of others
2. Keep content relevant to the project
3. Use appropriate categories
4. Search existing discussions before creating a new one
